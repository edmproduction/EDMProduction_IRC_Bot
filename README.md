threadbot
=========

Threadbot for reddit, currently tailored towards /r/edmproduction with a goal of making it generic.

This is what a config file should look like for /r/myWonderfulTerrificSubreddit


	[threadbot]
	subreddit = myWonderfulTerrificSubreddit
	username = mySuperCoolUsername
	password = mySuperSecurePassword
	debug_day = 0 # if this parameter is there, it overrides the weekday (0=Monday, 1=Tuesday, ...)
